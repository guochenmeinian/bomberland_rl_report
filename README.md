This repository hosts the web report for our project on **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** in the [Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland) environment.

The project focuses on training multiple agents using attention-based policy networks, optimized with PPO, GAE, LSTM and self-play strategies.

## About

[Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland) is a multi-agent AI competition inspired by the classic console game Bomberman.

Teams build intelligent agents using strategies from tree search to deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to compete in a 2D grid world collecting power-ups and placing explosives to take your opponent down.
