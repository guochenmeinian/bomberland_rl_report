# Bomberland Project Report

## About

[Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland) is a multi-agent AI competition inspired by the classic console game Bomberman.

Teams build intelligent agents using strategies from tree search to deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to compete in a 2D grid world collecting power-ups and placing explosives to take your opponent down.

This repo hosts our [web report](https://guochenmeinian.github.io/bomberland_rl_report/) for our [implementation](https://github.com/guochenmeinian/bomberland_rl_agents.git) for our project.
